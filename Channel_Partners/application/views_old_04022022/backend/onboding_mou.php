                               <!-- ----------------- -->

                               <p>. Once the payment is done to the Seller by the Financer and Transaction fee is received, this flag is removed automatically from the Seller’s name</p>

                               <p><strong>*Pre-Sanction Documents</strong>
                                are a set of documents required by the trained finance personnel of the IGCPPL G_CASH team to explore financing options for the Seller. These include, but are not limited to, Order & past supply details, KYC, financial documents (ITR, Balance Sheet etc.), and any other business-related documents..</p>

                                <p><strong>#Financer Identification </strong>
                                is done by the G_CASH team on basis the Sellers’ credentials and business status. Eg. A large Private Limited company may be able to get financing from most Banks and larger NBFCs, a smaller but old Partnership firm with a long history of supplies may be able to get financing from a few Banks and NBFCs, whereas for a proprietorship firm which has just started operations G_CASH team may have to arrange finances from a smaller NBFC or and AIF fund.  </p>

                                <p><strong>** Onetime fee </strong>
                                will be as negotiated and agreed with the Seller</p>

                                <p><strong>## Sanction Document Execution & Limit Setup-  </strong>
                                This is the final stage before any discounting transaction can be executed. Each financer may have a different set of documents required to be signed by the Seller depending on the security offered, financial status of the seller, and the product (Bill Discounting or Factoring etc.). These will always include a <strong>Deed of Assignment 4(DoA)</strong> which will specify the account number of the Seller with the Financer where final payments are to be made by the GEM Buyer</p>

                                <p><strong>1 Service Level Agreement (SLA) – </strong>
                                This agreement will be signed by the Seller with IGCPPL (IGCPPL may sign a back-to-back SLA with another Service Provider for the same specifying the terms and commercials of the discounting/factoring facility being provided. The SLA will also carry an indemnity clause in favour of IGCPPL for frauds, payment rejection, defective/short supply etc. The SLA will also carry an authorization from the Seller authorizing IGCPPL or its designated partners/agents to submit the documents to GEMs on his behalf.</p>
                                <p>Ideally, the SLA will be signed with the Seller post identification of financers and payment of a one-time fee by the Seller. </p>
                                
                                <h4><strong>Format of a sample SLA will be shared seperately.</strong></h4>
                                <br>
                                <p><strong>2 Transaction Fee – </strong>
                                This will be mutually negotiated and agreed between IGCPPL and the Seller and may depend on various factors – number of Financers arranged, Rate of Interest offered, type of product etc. Typically, the transaction fee will be a percentage of the invoice amount and related to the Interest rate being offered for discounting/factoring.</p>

                                <p><strong> 3 Number of Financers </strong>
                                will depend on the type, frequency and volume of supplies being made by the seller. For eg. - a large Seller with high volumes may prefer multiple financers to hedge his risk and reduce interest cost.</p>

                                <p><strong>4 Deed of Assignment (DoA) </strong>
                                is a standard legal document through which the Seller Assigns the receivables of the Transaction to be paid into the Financer’s account on due date to set off the discounting transaction. It is governed by the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 and Factoring Regulation Amendment Act, 2021.</p>

                                <h4><strong>Format of a DoA will be shared separately.</strong></h4>
                                <br>
                                <p><strong>5 Transaction Documents </strong>
                                is a standard legal document through which the Seller Assigns the receivables of the Transaction to be paid into the Financer’s account on due date to set off the discounting transaction. It is governed by the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 and Factoring Regulation Amendment Act, 2021.</p>

                                <p><strong>6 Notice of Assignment –  </strong>
                                A Notice of Assignment (NoA) communicates the Buyer’s acceptance to pay the Seller in the designated account on the due date after release of the CRAC.</p>

                                <h4><strong> Format of a sample NoA will be shared separately.</strong></h4>
                                <br>
                                <p><strong>7  Flags </strong>
                                should be created in the system for each transaction step – so an MIS should be readily available to the management & sellers on the status of supply, acceptance and payment for each transaction.</p>

                                <p>8 The upload/sharing of documents with the Financer may happen in one, two or more steps. This will depend on individual Financers’ requirements and policies. Eg. Some Financers may require the transaction documents to be submitted at each step starting from Invoice generation, others may want all documents in one go – post generation of CRAC.</p>

                                <p>9 This is as per RBI guidelines – all Working Capital fund flow credits should happen the Working Capital Bank account of the Borrower – in this case, the Seller. This will form a part of the DoA and the initial agreement between the Financer and the Seller.</p>
